Approximate workflow with the library:
you create widgets
you can pack widgets into windows and {h,v}boxes
 some widgets can be packed into others as well if it makes sense
  (list items into listbox?)
one can create as many windows as he wants
once a widget has been packed into one window, it can then be packed
 into another and it will move to that window without any additional help
widgets are controlled through properties.
you can set and get properties
properties are settable and gettable even if widget has never been
 packed anywhere before
all text returned from the library and sent into library is encoded in UTF-8
when packing into a window it acts as a vbox
boxes have properties padding, which is an inside invisible border, and spacing,
 the space between packed child widgets
each widget has a expand and fill property, expand means the widget will eat all
 the space available to it, fill means widget will also actually become as large
 as the space available to it

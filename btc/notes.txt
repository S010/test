Block height - the ordinal number of a block, due to potential blockchain forks
cannot be used as a unique identifier of a block, block header's hash can be
used for this purpose.

Coinbase transaction - the initial transaction in a block which collects the
mining reward and the transaction fees and spends them.

UTXO - unspent transaction output.

Transaction identifier (TXID) - hash of transaction's rawtransaction
representation.


A P2P network peer

struct peer_buf {
	uint8_t *ptr; // pointer to data
	size_t len; // length of data it contains
	size_t size; // size of the buffer pointer to by ptr
};

struct peer {
	state // current state of our connection with them
	address // their address
	version // the version message we received
	buffer // incoming message buffer
	next // pointer to next peer
};
